# Grip
*Generate Recursive Interesting Planets*

[Try in browser](https://troido.nl/grip/) or download the [latest release](https://github.com/jmdejong/grip/releases/latest)

Procedural generation experiment to create planets that generate generating higher level of detail on the fly as distance to area decreases.

The goal of this experiment is to create a planet that looks good and loads fast when looking at the whole planet, but also allows you to walk through the world.

## Controls
- Mouse: look around
- WASD/arrow keys: move horizonally (distance to the center of the planet remains approximately equal
- Space and C: move up and down (away from / towards center of planet)
- Shift: holding shift while moving makes you much faster
- Ctrl: holding ctrl while moving makes you even faster
- M: place a marker at the current position
- P: cycle through the debug rendering modes (not all rendering modes work in the web version)
